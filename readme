Bookcrumbs App

We have solved the problem of 'Now we're gona discuss what we've read' for online classes. 
When you want to discuss sections of a reading with large amounts of people, Bookcrumbs facilitates that.

Bookcrumbs is an app that pulls in Penguin Classic's Best 100 novels from Pearson's API and allows users to collaboratively leave notes anywhere on the book in real-time.
